# Genetare-TV-Scripts
Generate TV scripts using Recurrent Neural Network

# Project Overview

In this project a new type of Neural Networks is used to generate fake TV scripts of a TV show and it is one of the most interesting project i have done in Deep learning Nano-Degree using Recurrent neural networks. In this project, I have generated my own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. I have used part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from many seasons. The Neural Network I have built will generate a new, "fake" TV script. and in this project many concepts are covered like Recurrent Neural Networks, Tensorflow, Embeddings and Word2Vec.
and there are severla steps for doing this job:
* Get and explore the Data
* preprocess the data
* create Lookup Table, give tokens to the words
* save the data
* Build the Neural Network
* modeling and training the network
* tuning the hyperparameters
* Generate TV Script
* Generate Text and new script

# Dependencies
this code is written in python language and some libraries are needed:
Python 3, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Torchvision, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras
